# Interview Summary

This project is a multi-agent reinforcement learning and path-finding system for drones. 
The core idea is that instead of waiting for delayed success signals, the drone scores every action instantly against internal principles such as safety, energy efficiency, and smooth movement.

The architecture is built around three agents: an Ingestion Agent that pulls in sensor data, 
a Preprocess Agent that cleans and compresses it, and a Prediction Agent that uses a PPO policy to choose the next action. 
On top of that, there is a Safety Controller that can veto unsafe moves and a Supervisor that monitors and restarts agents if anything fails.

From an engineering perspective, the system comes with a FastAPI service exposing /predict, /metrics, and /healthz. 
That means it is production-ready: you can train the model, run inference through an API, monitor it with Prometheus and Grafana, and deploy it via Docker or Kubernetes.

The value here is combining research in reinforcement learning and alignment scoring with real production concerns such as monitoring, safety overrides, and deployment pipelines. 
It is not just an RL demo; it is an end-to-end system that shows how to make AI safe, observable, and operational in real time.
