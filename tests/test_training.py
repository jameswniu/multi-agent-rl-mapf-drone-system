Training Integration Tests
--------------------------
These tests check that training and inference run end-to-end
without crashing. They donâ€™t test convergence (because RL is stochastic),
but they confirm that:
- The environment and agent connect properly.
- Training loop runs for a few episodes.
- The model can be saved and loaded.
- Inference (prediction) works on a trained agent.
